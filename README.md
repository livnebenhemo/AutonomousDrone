* Clone the GitHub repo
```
git clone https://github.com/RonelShorPacker/Zoom_Automation_in_Python.git
```
* Install Opencv with the following link: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-opencv-on-ubuntu-20-04/

Afterwards, you need to install the Eigen library.

Once you've done that, run
'''
chmod +x installDep.sh
./installDep
'''
 If there are problems with flip.cpp in ctello/examples, change add "include" to the ctello.h in the file.
